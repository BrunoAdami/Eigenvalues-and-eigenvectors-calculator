# Eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors-calculator
A program written in C that calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square symmetric matrices.

To run the program, first compile it and then execute it on the terminal. You will be asked to enter the size of the matrix (up to 100x100) and then define the value of epsilon (the more close to zero epsilon is the more accurate are the results).
After that just click enter and you will have an aproximation of the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the matrix.
